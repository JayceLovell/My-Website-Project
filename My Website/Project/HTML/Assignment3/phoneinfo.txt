The OnePlus One features a 5.5” 1080p full HD JDI screen with LTPS technology for a higher pixel density and sharper picture. The IPS screen instantaneously responds to even the slightest touch with TOL (Touch on Lens) technology, which removes the distance between the touch sensor and the display panel. It also makes the screen 300% more shatterproof than OGS technology. Gorilla© Glass 3 protects the screen against scratches, and with 178 degree vision, you can enjoy it from just about any angle.
